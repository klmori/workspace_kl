# ‚úÖ Purpose
# The Prototype Design Pattern is used to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It helps in situations where object creation is costly or complex (e.g., database calls, network I/O, or heavy computations).

# üè™ Real-Life Analogy: Cloning a Product Catalog
# Imagine an e-commerce platform like Zepto. When launching a new store, instead of re-entering all product details, they clone the catalog from another existing store and customize it.

# üéØ Why Use Prototype?
# When object creation is expensive or slow

# When objects have many configuration options

# When you need to decouple object creation from usage



# üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Use Cases
# Domain	Example
# Game Dev	Cloning enemies or player units
# Design Software	Duplicate shapes with properties
# E-commerce	Clone product templates
# UI Systems	Reuse component trees (forms, templates)
