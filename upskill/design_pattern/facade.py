# Provide a simplified interface to a complex system (multiple classes/subsystems).

# To order food, you donâ€™t talk to the chef, cashier, and manager.
# â†’ You just use the counter guy (the facade) to deal with everything.


# ðŸ’¼ Scenario:
# You want to book a flight, which involves:

# Searching flights

# Booking a seat

# Sending confirmation

# Logging

# You want clients to use 1 method, not 4 systems.
