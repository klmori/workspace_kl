# ðŸ“Œ Purpose
# The Flyweight Pattern is used to minimize memory usage by sharing common, reusable objects (called flyweights) instead of creating new ones each time.

# It's especially useful when dealing with a large number of similar objects â€” like characters in a document, map tiles in a game, or icons in a file explorer.

# ðŸ§  When to Use Flyweight Pattern
# Rendering engines (games, GUIs)

# Large documents (thousands of similar symbols)

# Caching and pooling (like database connections)

# Map tiles / icons (e.g., file explorers)
